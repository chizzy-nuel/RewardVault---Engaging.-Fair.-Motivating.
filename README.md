## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
```clarity
rewards        -> Available prizes and redemption options
user-activity  -> Individual participation stats and streaks
daily-activity -> Day-by-day engagement tracking
user-claims    -> Reward redemption history
```

### Token System
- **Reward Points**: Fungible tokens earned through activities
- **STX Rewards**: Direct payments for high-value prizes
- **Streak System**: Multiplier bonuses for consistent participation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Community Members

1. **Earn Points**: Participate in community activities
   ```clarity
   (earn-activity-points points "posting")
   ```

2. **Build Streaks**: Daily participation increases point multipliers
3. **Redeem Rewards**: Exchange points for valuable prizes
   ```clarity
   (claim-reward reward-id)
   ```

### For Community Admins

1. **Create Rewards**: Set up attractive redemption options
   ```clarity
   (create-reward title description point-cost stx-value max-claims)
   ```

2. **Award Bonuses**: Recognize exceptional contributions
   ```clarity
   (award-bonus-points recipient points reason)
   ```

3. **Fund Vault**: Add STX for reward payouts
   ```clarity
   (fund-reward-vault amount)
   ```

## üìà Example Scenarios

### Daily Engagement
```
1. Alice posts helpful content: earns 50 points (day 1, no bonus)
2. Bob comments regularly: earns 30 points + 1.2x streak = 36 points (day 5)
3. Charlie maintains 7-day streak: earns 100 points + 2x bonus = 200 points
4. All build toward valuable reward redemptions
```

### Reward Redemption
```
1. Admin creates "Exclusive NFT Access" reward: 500 points, 5 max claims
2. Dave accumulates 520 points over 2 weeks of participation
3. Dave redeems reward: spends 500 points, gains exclusive access
4. Only 4 claims remaining, creating urgency for other users
```

### Community Recognition
```
1. Eve provides exceptional help to new members
2. Admin awards 200 bonus points: "Outstanding community support"
3. Eve's contribution is recognized and incentivized
4. Other members motivated to provide similar value
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Point System
- **Maximum per Action**: 1,000 points with streak bonuses
- **Minimum Reward Cost**: 10 points for basic rewards
- **Activity Cooldown**: 1 day between point-earning activities
- **Streak Multipliers**: Up to 2x bonus for consistent participation

### Reward Management
- **Limited Quantities**: Each reward has maximum claim limits

- **Activity Types**: Flexible categorization (posting, commenting, helping, etc.)

## üîí Security Features

ERR-REWARD-NOT-FOUND (u21)   -> Invalid reward ID
ERR-INSUFFICIENT-POINTS (u22) -> Not enough points for reward
ERR-REWARD-INACTIVE (u23)    -> Reward unavailable or sold out
